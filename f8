A flood is an overflow of water that covers land that is normally dry. This occurs when water levels in a body of water, like a river, rise and exceed its banks, or when heavy rainfall causes water to accumulate and saturate the ground. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Overflowing Water:
Floods occur when water from a river, lake, or other body of water exceeds its normal boundaries and spills onto the surrounding land. 
Heavy Rainfall:
Excessive rainfall can also lead to flooding, particularly in areas with poor drainage or where the ground is already saturated. 
Other Causes:
Floods can also be caused by rapid snowmelt, dam failures, or even storm surges in coastal areas. 
Submerging Normally Dry Land:
The key characteristic of a flood is that it submerges land that is typically dry.
